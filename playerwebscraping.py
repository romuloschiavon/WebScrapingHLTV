    here we are going to webscrape the individual stats of the players for each match they played
    this is difficult because they're a lot of tables and a lot of diferrent pages that must be acessed
    for gathering the information of every single match, we even are going to display the heat map of those
    players so they now exactly where they're getting killed the most often.


    Im going to try to implement Scrapy webScraping in here, because I want to learn the libraby
